Well, hello!

I started this blog to write about Cloud computing, Research
and Frickeleien (a wonderful [word from the Rhineland](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b5/De-frickeln.ogg)).
All posts are meant to help me digesting all the wonderful things I learn. Some
of them will hopefully be helpful to others.

Happy frickeling!
