Since today I'm officially a [Microsoft Azure Solutions
Architect](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/azure-solutions-architect.aspx). All it took
was two months of drinking from the fire-hose, ha! 

To get there I needed to pass the AZ-300 (Microsoft
Azure Architect Technologies) and AZ-301 (Microsoft Azure Architect Design) exams, which cover an
awful lot of ground. Retrospectively I'd say the following three resources were the most useful:
- [Microsoft Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/)
- [Azure
docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/) (yes...)
- and the [Skylines Academies'](https://www.skylinesacademy.com/) [AZ-300](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/microsoft-az-300-certification/1018947654/) and [AZ-301](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/microsoft-az-301-certification/1018947653/) videos
  (via O'Reilly)


The [AZ-300 exam](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/exam-AZ-300.aspx) takes officially three hours and I needed that time, even though one lab didn't even start. [AZ-301](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/exam-AZ-301.aspx) (no labs) takes even longer (210 minutes), but I was done after two hours. The actual exam questions were biased towards WebApps (for AZ-300), AD and SQL and you need to know SLAs and details about tiers.

Anyway, achievement unlocked!
